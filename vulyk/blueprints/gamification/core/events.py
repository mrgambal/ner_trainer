"""
Here go all types of events to happen during the project's lifecycle.

By default all 'on task done' events add some non-zero amount of coins and
points. Achievements and levels are conditional things.

Another type of events is donations to some funds. These ones must contain
a link to a fund and negative amount of coins, along with zero points,
no achievements (at least â€“ for now) and no level changes.
